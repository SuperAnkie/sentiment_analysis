This is a single-labelled multi-classification task, which processes the data from Kaggle (https:// www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). From the raw data, rate(1-5) and reviews(text) are extracted, cleaned and tokenized, an embedding layer is used to further process the data in order to be trained in a deep learning model(GRU) which can predict rate of random review.
